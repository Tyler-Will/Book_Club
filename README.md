# Overview and Basic Functionality
This app is a personal project that I began working on infrequently near the end of my Web Development Bootcamp. It is a web app intended to aid in the organization and planning of Book Clubs and similar gatherings. The final product will consist of a user page and an admin page. The user page is intended to advertise the event, provide information on the book that will be discussed fot the month, and maintain a record of books that have been read for previous months. The admin page will allow the organizer to update the user page by selecting the book for the month, record information on previous books and make other adjustments to the site without having to directly update the code. Information will be stored in an authentication protected database.


## Stretch Goals
Other goals for the project after basic functionality has been achieved will include user authentication for the user page. This will allow me to safely make the user page more interactive.


### To-Do-List (User)
-Additional styling and formatting.
-Some way of submitting books for approval.
-For some reason hyperlinks are not displaying on the Homepage and Bookshelf. Might be a Bootstrap issue.

### To-Do-List (Admin)
-Books table is accessible from and visible on Admin Page but data can only be viewed at the moment.
-Page is meant to resemble a SQL Table but with a more wieldy interface. This will allow the Admin to update and add books without utilizing the Database directly.
